# MM Recognizer
 
We have a set of maker's marks (simplified binary images, stored in a folder) that people use to identify their ceramic pieces. I would like to develop an algorithm to figure out which maker's mark is shown in a picture (or live camera feed). The marks may be hard to read, distorted, in a different color or otherwise altered.
